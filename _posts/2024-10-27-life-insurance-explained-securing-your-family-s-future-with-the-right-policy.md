Understanding life insurance and selecting the right policy can significantly impact your family's financial future. This article will explain the basics of life insurance and how it can protect those you care about most.

## What is Life Insurance?

Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company. In exchange for regular premium payments, the insurer agrees to pay a specified sum of money, known as the death benefit, to the designated beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death.

### Types of Life Insurance

Understanding the different types of life insurance is crucial for choosing the right policy. Here are the main categories:

   - **Pros**: Generally more affordable; straightforward; ideal for covering temporary financial obligations like a mortgage or education costs.
   - **Cons**: No cash value; coverage ends when the term expires.
