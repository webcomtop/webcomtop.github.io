I just finished a startup accelerator program where talented individuals and early stage startups come together to develop ideas, 
form teams and build MVPs with support from experts.

## Unlucky me (?)

My first disappointment was not being accepted into my top choice startup, which already had a full team.
But I managed to follow them in the building process after the program and test and review their product, not a total loss!

## 3D-Printing for (almost) everybody

My second choice was a 3D printing on demand startup aiming to make 3D printing more accessible, affordable, sustainable and customizable for the masses.
I joined the team, excited to be part of the 3D printing revolution! But alas, our lofty goals quickly crumbled as we ended up building custom 3D prints for influencers.
I soon lost interest as the startup strayed from its initial noble mission.

*Seems the lure of Instagram sponsorships was just too tempting.*

The team size gradually halved over time, as excitement turned to existential dread.

After pitching at the final event in front of investors, experts and a jury, the startup didn't make it in the top3.


> But really, printing 3D Photos of your fav influecer? Not my idea of changing the world.

## Embrace Failure

However, I gained so much valuable information and knowledge about startup development that I'll likely not repeat the same hilarious mistakes in the future.
Thanks also to my Mentor who kindly tried to tranfer as much knowledge as possible in 4, 30min 1:1 meetings.

Overall it was a rewarding and fun experience and educational because it was all online with like-minded people from across Europe.


Failure may be funny but it's also the path to success, and this experience taught me that in a painfully funny way. 
I finished the program with high hopes, wisdom earned the hard yet hilarious way, and motivation to keep going.
